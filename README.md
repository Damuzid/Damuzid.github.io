## My process

I started out with creating the layout with div elements to get the two "columns" of the preview card, which I then made responsive with flexbox. When I had that working I implemented the product images and font styling/padding. The last part was creating the button including a hover colorchange.

### Built with

- Non-semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned the basics of using @media to create a responsive layout and what you can do with flexbox. Altough it feels I kinda brute forced it with alot of div elements nested as a result.

### Continued development

Learn to use more semantic markup in my HTML code, which i didn't use at all. And a better understanding of flexbox and CSS in general. Read up on how to use Github.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I used the Mozilla Web Docs for information on flexbox.
